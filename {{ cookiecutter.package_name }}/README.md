# Default Django project

Author: Pavel Studen√≠k

Template for deploying Django project in Docker image by Ansible script to production.

Project is only template for project. But it is possible to build and run it as default.
For local build of docker image you can use command:

```
docker build -t proj .
```

For deploying on production it is used Ansible script. The file config/hosts.ini contains hostname of target server.

```
ansible-playbook -i config/hosts.ini deploy.yaml
```

Test:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app coala/base:0.11 coala -n
```
